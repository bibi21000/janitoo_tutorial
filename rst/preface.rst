Preface
=======

In short words, Janitoo is a protocol based on mqtt and an API that allows rapid development for Raspberry Pi (mainly but not only).
In this tutorial, you'll develop a `server <https://github.com/bibi21000/janitoo_tutorial/blob/master/src/janitoo_tutorial/tutorial1.py>`_
that reports temperature of the CPU, a DHT sensor and a Onewire sensor in less than 100 lines of code.

The protocol is approximatively 60% developped : fixed addresses, primary nodes are functionnals.

The protocol implements the concepts of network, nodes and values :

- a network holds nodes
- primary nodes and secondary nodes holds a map of the network
- a secondary node can became primary if the primary fails
- primary nodes (and maybe secondary ones) will send heartbeat for nodes in timeout
- a node holds values
- a node send its state periodically on the network (heartbeat).
- a value holds instances (not fully supported)
- values have genres : 'basic', 'user', 'config', 'system', 'command'
- values implements cmd_class : a capacity (ie switch, dimmer, ... ), a config, ...

If you're famillar with Zwave (https://github.com/OpenZWave/open-zwave), Janitoo's protocol is a kind of Zwave over mqtt.

The API implements the concepts of thread/bus, components and values :

- a bus allows to share resources between its holded components. Each bus run in its own thread.
  A bus is mapped to a node in the protocol (in a controller node to be more precise)
- a component is mapped to a node

You can see Janitoo in action on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3Gqj32sJ-Q and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Vx6uARhTfQ.

About this tutorial
===================

- it will take 1 or 2 hours for the all tutorial (or maybe less).
- all code is provided, just look at the specified file to look around.
- all configuration files are provided, you simply need to copy them the right place.

For the impatient that don't want to test the API (with a Raspberry Pi), jump :doc:`here <many_servers>`.


Notes
=====
- for geeks only : there is a lot of bugs, so you surely need to get your hands dirty
- the tk UI is 50% functionnal : update are not propagated, ...
- the web manager is 20% functionnal : you can only browse values, no updates. There is a huge memory hole in it (with socketio)
- the flask socketio server and socketio server are under heavy development after a period of inactivity, so installation problems will occurs
- maybe we should use websockets instead
